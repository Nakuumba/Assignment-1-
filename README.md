Assignment 1 done by Group 59

The points that need to be satisfied are as follows:creates value for the business measured in financial returns per product/service portfolio, 
create efficiency in the human resource function, create customer relationship management database to serve as a sales tool.

We decided to create a Webpage that both contains information about Ayesha and once the customers gain interest they can become exclusive members by signing up for a
Virtual Phone platform that allows them to buy the latest products and communicate directly with the company all whole receiving exclusive deals.

contributor (George Diyeve)

Module 2  
Beauty Queens 

Hair Style Catalogue
When a customer whether old or new, they can view the different hair styles that Ayeshaâ€™s business offers. They are able to see the hairstyles from different angles and view they price and time it would potential take to complete. 
This will put a customer at ease that they people doing their hair are professionals that are capable of doing a great job. This process will be simple for the customer to use.

Conclusion the apps are supposed to be created in a more fun way that allow the user to feel like 
they are part of something special. The data stored on the phone allows for easier interaction between users and management.
